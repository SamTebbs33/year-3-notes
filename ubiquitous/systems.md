# Systems

## Constraints
* Resource constraints (memory, battery)
* Processing power

There is a constant battle between the two, and batteries haven't developed at the same rate as digital technology.

## Communication
HTTP APIs can be used to smooth the interaction between devices. Some wireless communication methods can't be used in all environment, due to interference and environmental restrictions.

## Security
Keeping mobile and ubiquitous devices patched and secure is difficult.

## Dynamic environments
Mobile devices can be taken to different environments, and this must be taken into account when designing. All systems will be met with unexpected scenarios, and a system can handle these limitations
* **Pessimistically**: Decline to function (decline to work if there's no internet connection)
* **Optimistically**: Present previous valid data (last weather update)
* **Cautiously**: Present data but with warning (maps location with large error radius)
