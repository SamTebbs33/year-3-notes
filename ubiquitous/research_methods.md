# Research methods

## Field studies
Concept where you do research in the context of the product/project's use (hospital for medical devices etc.).

An overall *epistemic* approach, but is not the specific method of gathering data.

Experiments must be set up systematically to infer causal relationships between variables and measuring.

## Telemetry
* Works in the background
* 24/7 data collection
* Collects lots of very fine grained data
  * Understanding small and subtle effects
* Sensors can be noisy and generate lots of data (what is relevant?)
* There could be privacy concerns

## Interviews
* **Structured**: All questions are planned before hand
* **Semi-structured**: Some questions are planned and topics are known, follow-up questions are common
* **Unstructured**: Only a general theme is planned

Richer insights possible, following up on interesting points, gaining new understanding from participants.

Limited sample, time-consuming (collection and transcription)

## Observations
Watching what people are doing.

You can see exactly what is happening, gives you chance to observe details that might otherwise have been seen as too trivial to report, physical aspects of interactions can be mapped.

Difficult to organise and get access to context of interest, researcher's presence may affect the participants' behaviour.

## Ethnography
Not generalisable knowledge, very specific to a certain context.
