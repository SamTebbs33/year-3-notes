# Visual search
Primary visual features (size, shape, colour etc.) are used as guidance when performing a visual search.

Difference in colour is the major differentiator between objects, then size and shape (Kieras and Hornof 2014)

Different colours can still be perceived at larger degrees of visual angle than shape and size.
