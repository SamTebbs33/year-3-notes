# Speciation
Restricts mating to similar individuals and discourages mating of individuals from different species (xD). To apply a speciation method, individuals representing each species must be found first. The speciation method cannot be used independently. Niching and speciation are complementary. Similarity can be measured either at the genotypic or phenotypic levels.
