# Co-evolution
Fitness of individuals depends on other individuals as the fitness landscape can change or the fitness of an individual may be different between runs.

Change in one individual will change the fitness landscape in others.

Types:
* By evaluation
  * Competitive (e.g Cheetah vs gazelle)
  * Cooperative (e.g Prisoner's dilemma)
* By population -organisation
  * Inter-population (e.g Sorting network genetic algorithm using competitive co-evolution)
  * Intra-population

## Why use co-evolution?
* When there is no known fitness function
* When there are too many fitness cases to test when evaluating fitness
  * Co-evolve fitness and cases
* If the problem can be broken down. Divide and conquer
