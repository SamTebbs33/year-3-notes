# Security and privacy
Data is stored all over the physical environment (light bulbs, doors etc.) and that data can be transferred anywhere in the world instantly. The systems used are standardised (HTTP etc.), breaking one can break them all.

## RFID tags
Simply an integrated circuit with a limited data store and a coil, which acts as a power source and antenna.

They act as resource locators as they allow us to map something physical to something digital.

### Vulnerability
* **Work without human input**: No human control
* Can be completely and secretively concealed
* **Clandestine scanning**: Powerful readers can pass by a pocket with an RFID card and read data
* **Eavesdropping**: Tampering with existing readers to make people tap into your own system when they tap into an existing system
* **Location tracking**: Tracking someone's movements between places fitted with readers

Loads of data goes to the cloud, mostly to AWS.
